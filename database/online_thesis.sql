Ethnic textiles can be used for more than just fashion and can be made into functional, innovative, and modernized products that benefit weavers to increase sales and production.\r\n\r\nApparel has gained immense value in the market, thanks to society\'s changing perception over the years. Hats, clothes, and bags worn on the body are now highly acceptable and in demand. Today\'s timeliness and relevance have given rise to a new platform for apparel that showcases identity and innovation. Students, professionals, and travelers want practical and creative products to make their daily activities easier and more comfortable.', '', 'raytos.r.bsinfotech@gmail.com', 'Allones, Hyna Nazen L., Enciso, John Dexter A., Madaya, Juaymah M.', '', '../pdf_files/65acba68408fe-INCORPORATING ETHNIC PATTERNS WITH CONTEMPORARY GRAPHIC DESIGN TO APPAREL_ AN INNOVAYION--CAFA.pdf', '2024-09-28', 'Accepted'),

This is an open -access article under the CC BY license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ) \nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.31838/jcr.07.11.41  \n  \nINTRODUCTION  \nDue to the threat of the COVID -19, many educational institutions \nin Region IV -A have suspended their academic activities and \nclasses. All the non -teaching personnel had to stop working and \nadvised by the President of the Philippines to stay at  home. \nCOVID -19 is a disease that could easily infect the immune system \nthat can cause greater harm to individuals who are infected. \nMany countries have declared a national emergency just like the \nPhilippines and the United States of America. De Guzman and  \nPastor [1] opines that the COVID -19 has no positive impact on \nthe world most especially on academic institutions like that of a \nHigher Educational Institutions (HEIs) of learning.  Most of the \ncities around the Philippines are empty.   All types of vehicl es are \nfew.  Important business establishments are open.  Conferences \nand meetings are strictly prohibited. Flights to and fro are \naffected and they have been grounded.  Some grocery stores and \ndrug stores are being emptied of masks, hand sanitizers, and \ndisinfecting medications. Students are advised to stay home and \nstudy by their own selves.  Everyone is in doubt as to when this \ncrisis would end [2].  \n   \nThere were no empirical studies related to the E -learning \nClassroom as an intervention in times of cri sis, or studies related \nto determine the status of E -Learning Classrooms in HEI’s; \nhowever, there are several researches that discuss E -Learning as \nan effective tool or strategy in teaching.  Chua, Sibbaluca, Mack, \net.al[3] suggested using the Virtual Lear ning Environment (VLE) \nas a technical tool for promoting the process of teaching and \nlearning. According to them, teachers should be innovative in \ndeveloping such an analytical learning atmosphere that will best \nfit the needs of today\'s generation of stude nts. \n McHaney, Reiter, and Reychay [4 ] confirm that simulation -based \nonline when combined with good pedagogical approaches, \nappropriate technology and educational technology, and the \npresence of experts will provide a better experience in \nsimulations.  Simulations could be so motivating tool for e -\nlearning classroom.  Bekmurat[5 ] mentions that because \ncomputer technology and the Internet are both boundless even a \nsmall boy has already been equipped with a device or a cell \nphone. It\'s no sur prise that new innovations have been part of \nthe cycle of teaching and learning.  \n \nThus, they recommend that teachers should make use of \nsimulations to integrate this effectively into their teaching \napproaches.  \n \nThe administrators, Deans, Heads, professors may work together \nto come up with the best E -learning solutions as an immediate \nintervention in these times of crisis.   \n \nThe researchers of this stud y initiated a survey to find out the \nstatus of the E -Learning Classrooms in various HEI’s in the \ncountry.  To learn their status means to provide the best \nalternative learning mode for the students and faculty members \nand to discover the best recommendatio ns from them while \ncurrently experiencing the E -learning Classrooms amidst the \nCOVID -19.    \n \nResearch Objective  \nThe main objective of this study was to find out the status of the \nimplementation of selected Higher Educational Institutions \n(HEIs) in Region I V-A in the conduct of their E -Learning \nClassrooms.  Specifically, it determined the experiences of faculty \nmembers in using the E -learning classroom; identified whether THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            254 \n \n the intervention was appropriate to each course; and discovered \nthe various types of fr ee platforms online.  Finally, the \nresearchers were able to find out some problems concerning the \nuse of the E -learning classrooms and possible solutions to \nimprove this type of intervention.  \n \nScope and Delimitation  \nThe study is limited to identifying the  status of the \nimplementation of the E -learning Classrooms in selected HEI’s in \nRegion IV -A and in determining the problems encountered with \nsome possible solutions to improve this intervention process.  \n \nThe Significance of the Study  \nThis action research will serve as a step -by-step guide to develop \nan in -depth analysis of the E -learning implementation in HEIs in \ntimes of emergencies such as the COVID -19.  This is also \napplicable to all types of urgencies when class suspensions have \nbeen declared by the in stitution or the whole country.  \n \nConceptual Framework of the Study  \nThe research paradigm used in this study is an action research \nwhich is generally common to qualitative research paradigm.  It \nincludes documentary collection and analysis, participant \nobservation using the online survey. The findings of the study \nwill ser ve as future work in conducting a structured interview to \nfurther improve the decisions in this study.  \n \nMETHODS AND PROCEDURE  \nThe work was carried out in three (3) stages. The first step was \nsearching online academic journals for the appropriate research  \npapers. The second step was the online survey of 15 professors \nteaching at different courses in Philippine Area IV -A.  These \ncourses include: Math, English, History, Social Sciences, NSTP, \nMarketing, Business, Computer Science and Courses in \nProfessional Education. These professionals were sent the survey \nlink, and they answered open -ended questions. The third process \nused the descriptive and documentary analysis to collect and \nanalyze all the findings.  \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \nThe massive action on E-learning classroom was the decision of \nalmost all the HEI’s in the Philippines amidst this crisis.  \nHowever, the Commission on Higher Education has declared for \nleniency to all HEIs so that students could cope with the \nrequirements set by their professor s. The researchers have \ndistributed an onlin e survey called survey monkey [6 ] to find out \nthe status of implementation of their E -learning Classroom and \nas an immediate intervention in these times of crisis.  \nWhen asked about the professors’ experiences in  the \nimplementation of the E -Learning Classroom in the Philippines, \nmajority had the positive remarks as shown below:  \n \nFigure 1:  Experience in the Implementation of the E -\nLearning Classroom  \n \nThe 15 professionals who are all from Cavite, Philippines in \nRegion IV -A, who responded to this question, 93.33% had \npositive experiences in the E -learning Classroom while 6.66% had a negative experience.  Most of the respondents feel great, \nhappy, and con venient with this transition.  The learning will \nnever get interrupted.  Some of them believe that this was the \nbest solution for this kind of situation.  Some of the professors \nalso mentioned that they enjoy the use of the E -learning \nClassroom even if it was their first time to use this platform.  \nStudents were also responding as they point out that they also \nwant to learn while staying in their own homes.  It was indeed a \nnice experience for most of the participants and because E -\nlearning is new, there wa s difficulty at the beginning; however, as \nthey were exploring how to utilize the platform, this becomes \neasy to utilize.  One professor also points out that this idea is not \nso encouraging.  Students who have no means to do the E -\nlearning Classroom would be receiving  the lowest marks in the \nclassroom.  \n \nIt is evident that teachers who have been positive in the use of \nthe E -Learning classrooms are those who are motivated to teach \nand to learn the new technology. Teacher’s motivation plays a \nvital role in pr oviding the best strategies for students, whether \nonline or traditional classrooms. In a Blog posted by UNESCO in \nthe Learning Portal, in order to improve the motivation level and \nstatus of teachers, there is a need to uplift their status to retain \nhigh -quality teachers who are  vital to improving education [7 ]. In \nthis blog, they stressed that when there is full support from the \nwork environment, it would create a positive working \nrelationships among people and these may reduce and improve \nteachers’ motivat ion and effectiveness.  \n \nAlthough it was fun and easy, teachers may be able to learn more \nhow to conduct it with the students.  Overall, the professors who \nwere teaching in various courses have positive feelings and \nexperience in using the E -Learning Classroom.  \n \nQ2:  Is the E -learning Classroom applicable to your course? \nWhy?  \nTable 1:  Reasons for E -learning Classroom to be Applicable \nor Not  \nApplicable \nor Not \nApplicable  Course/s  \nTaught  Reasons  \nYes English  \n(Grammar)  Materials are accessible. \nAssessments can be \nconducted easily.  \n English  \n(Literature)  Activities can easily be done \nonline.  The links are all \navailable online.  \n Social Studies  Both traditional and \nmodern approaches are \nimportant in Social Studies \nfield.  \n Business  Best alternative mode of \nlearning in times of crisis.  \n Computer \nScience  Easy to communicate with \nstudents and the lessons \ncan easily be transferred to \nthem via E -learning \nplatforms.  \n Professional \nEducation  \nCourses  PowerPoint presentations \ncan be done.  Interactions \nare similar to the Face -to-\nFace classroom. Students \ncan be seen on video and \nthey speak naturally when \nquestions are asked.  \n  Our students are future \neducators and they need to \nexperience this type of \ntransition. They should get \nused to it and apply this in \nTHE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            255 \n \n the future.  \n Marketing  This is very convenient \nbecause it relates to online \nmarketing  \n Psychology  This is very relevan t. I could \neasily provide links to my \nstudents. They could raise \nquestions immediately.  \nYes and NO  NSTP  Our course is purely \ncommunity -based project, \nso its usefulness is less \nadvantageous  \nNO Math  It is difficult to explain the \nformula online. Face to  face \nis still the best way for \nthem to learn.  \n \nDuring this COVID -19 crisis, many private companies and \nbusiness corporations have provided the HEI’s temporary online \nmaterials or platforms to address the immediate need of \ninstitutions most especially the teachers and students. These \nonline classrooms are extremely beneficial for the students when \nusing E -learning, it is not only considered add -on, it has become \npart of the educational setting. For example, in the field of IT, \nhaving intensiv e hands on helps prepare students for their future \njob rather than us ing the traditional textbooks [7 ].  If the \ninstitutions combine hands on activities, lecture, and E -learning, \nstudents have higher retention rates and greater productivity.   \n \nAnother example of a business company that has just recently \nestablished their customized learning experience platform is the \nOdilo.  It is intended for all levels, for every user, and learning \nprofile (skills, interest, age, aspirational job, level, etc.) .  They \ndesign the platform to match the brand and unique values and \nculture of individuals or institutions.  They adapt the learning \nexperience and its content to meet the needs of every learner  [8]. \nAs Kamenez[9 ] is of the opinion that involving teaching , self -\nlearning and self -control of knowledge and teachers in \ninformation technology can have greater advantages over this \ntechnical knowledge.  \n \nThe issue of applicability depends on the creativity of the \nprofessor teaching the course and the availability of resources \nthe students may have.  However, now that many companies \nhave offered their free products and services, HEI’s should grab \nthe opportunity to make use of these available resources for their \nstudents.  These could be a great aid in their studies  while \nmaking themselves safe and secure in their homes.  \n \nQ3:  Which learning platforms are you currently using for \nyour students to learn at these times of crisis?  \n \n \nFigure 2:  Learning Platforms Used by the Professors  \n Most of the professors find the Facebook Messenger to be one of \nthe most convenient mode of alternative learning.  This is most \nespecially when the students could not afford to be connected \nwith Wi -Fi.  In FB messenger, if the students have free data, they  \ncould easily see the instruction of their professors including the \ntasks they need to do.  The Google Classroom is one of the best \nplatforms which could be accessed for free by an institution or an \nindividual faculty member.  In this platform, the profess or could \ncreate a class, assignments, tasks, announcements, or chats with \nhis/her students.  Edmodo is another popular E -learning \nplatform that has a similar feature like the Google Classroom. \nEdmodo is a user -friendly platform that could create a class, \nsubmit assignment, post a message or announcement, and could \nupload and share materials for the students.  Zoom is a free video \ncall meeting where a teacher can share his/her slide presentation \nthat everyone could see.  Students could interact and raise \nquestions to their professors.  They could also see each other \nonline and ask questions during the lecture.  For those who have \nslow connections, the professor could even write the important \nmessages on chat boards.  With this platform, students feel \ncomforta ble and easy to learn the topic.  Just like Google \nClassroom and Edmodo, Schoology allows the teachers to create \na class and uploads resources and materials online.  This is \nsomething new to them and would continue to explore its \nusefulness.  Google Meet h as similar features with Zoom. \nStudents could be seen online and interact with their teacher. \nMoodle has also a similar feature with Edmodo and Google \nClassroom while we chat is used for chatting and uploading \nmaterials to students. Although these E -learni ng platforms are \nfree, the availability of resources could be the hindrance why \nstudents or teachers could not fully utilize them.  However, \nteachers and students alike should be grateful that these E -\nlearning platforms could be available without charge fr om the \ninstitution or individual.  They make the academic life easier \nmost especially during these COVID -19 crises.  \n \nThe E -learning platforms the professors have been using are the \nmost popular ones.  However, there are other platforms which \nhave not been  explored yet like:  Lark, Odilo, Big Marker, and \nmany others. This means that e -Learning Classrooms are very \npopular around the world, most especially during crisis or \nemergency. The COVId -19 has revealed vulnerabilities in colleges \nand universities aroun d the globe.  It is clear that society needs \nflexible and resilient education systems while fac ing the \nunpredictable futures [10 ]. \n \nQ4:  How do your students respond to your alternative mode \nof learning?  \n \n \nTable 2:  Students’ Response to Alternative Learning Mode  \nN Students’ Response  \n1 Enjoyable, easy to use, it interests the students.  \n2 The students were active in the beginning, but they have \nstarted to be passive when they heard some \nannouncements about ONLINE suspension.  \n3 Enthusiastic. Some are not happy.  \n4 Positive  \n5 They could easily communicate during their preferred \ntime.  \n6 Responsive. They are interested to learn.  \n7 Happy. Sometimes they are confused due to many \nworkloads.  \n8 Extremely happy. They prefer this mode of learning to be \nwith their loved ones.  \n9 Positive a nd Negative responses because not all of them \nhave the Internet connections.  \n10 Protesting.  Many want to go on vacation.  \nN Students’ Response  \n11 They are interested to learn even if they only have free \nTHE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            256 \n \n data.  \n12 Enjoyable and exciting  \n13 At the beginning, it was difficult, but some of them go \nonline earlier than their professor.  \n14 Fine and fun  \n15 Not everyone is interested due to lack of resources.  \n \nIn general, students enjoy the E -learning platforms used by their \nprofessors. However, there were some who could not really get \nconnected due to slow connection or they have no capacity to \nproduce the resources.  To some students, it is their first time to  \nutilize these platforms and they have difficulty accessing them.  \nThey have limited time to learn how to utilize them thus, \ndelaying the submission of their assignments online.  To some \nstudents, they thought that this crisis is temporary and they \nprefer to go on vacation rather than to learn or to study, but they \nwere also those who are eager to learn and stay positive that this \ncrisis would not last long.  They believe that the intervention \nprovided to them is just temporary and the first thing to do is to \nobey or comply with their professors. Since the Commission on \nHigher Education has declared to be more lenient on E -learning \nclassroom issues, the professors become more humble to ask \ntheir students first before implementing a new platform.  This \naction  makes the students delighted and become interested to \nstudy.  \nIn comparison with Q1, teachers have enjoyed using the E -\nLearning classroom, however, students do have their positive as \nwell as negative experien ces too. In an article online [10 ], the \nauthors  brought out some positive as well as negative types of \nstudent experiences.  The shift from Face -to-Face classroom to \nthe e -learning sessions would mean an initial great increase in \nthe number of hours work both on the sides of students and \nteachers; howe ver, these may result to a very promising result.  \nOther institutions have already resorted to using coursera, zoom, \nand other videoconferencing platforms just to make sure that the \nteaching and learning process take place whether in an \nasynchronous or syn chronous approach.  The researchers would \nconclude that those universities who utilized these approaches \nseveral years ago would benefit from these e -learning \nclassrooms because they have enough experience with these \ntechnological tools and they could deli ver their own courses \ncorrectly and properly with the support of their institutions.   \n \nNevertheless, in the Philippines setting, colleges and universities \nhave struggled with accommodating the abrupt change from F -\nto-F to online learning due to lack of te chnological resources of \nfaculty members and students.  Undeniably, when the \nCommission on Higher Education declares to put leniency about \nthis online classroom issue, some institutions have totally \nsuspended their E -Learning Classroom classes.  However, s ome \nof these Universities have continued and offer a simple type of \nlearning on Facebook Messenger and simply sending messages \nvia E -mails. This means that many of these HEIs have not been \nready to face the new challenge, but there is a need to provide an \nurgent solution thus, E -Learning Classrooms have been created, \nwhether the institution is READY OR NOT?  \n \nIn some institutions in Australia, they also experienced difficulty \nof switching from F to F to online classes. Some professors and \ntheir leaders are facing problems in this immediate transition.   \nSome of their concerns are students do not have access to Wi-Fi \nor computers [11 ].  \n \nThe whole world is experiencing similar experiences, although \nstudents do enjoy learning online, they also struggle to find  \nsolutions to their own problems in order to learn and receive \ninstructions from their professors online. Those who could do \nsomething even amidst this COVID -19, are those who are really \nwilling to learn and continue to nourish their minds with \nknowledge.  Those who could not do anything could not be blamed because they had no means to do it even if they try all \ntheir best.   \n \nQ5:  How was the preparation of the e -learning Classroom?  \n(This is on the p art of the Professors in HEI’s)  \nThe majority of the respondents say that the preparation was \neasy.  There were eight who gladly share their preparation \nexperience.  The platform is accessible and very comfortable to \napply it while staying at home with their families.  One professor \nshare d that providing tasks to students is easy, but the burden on \nthe part of the teacher is the checking of their work because \nwhen these will all be collected, it will entail time and efforts to \ncorrect them.  Others do enjoy uploading of slide presentations  \nor sending them links to follow.  Some teachers say it was \ndifficult but rewarding most especially if you are the one making \nand editing the video. There were seven participants who \ndeclared difficult due to some reasons like: (1) no perfect Wi -Fi \nconnect ion, it was difficult to explain Math online, Social Studies \nneed an actual insight and opinion, so doing it online could be \ndifficult to express oneself.   \n \nAt the Royal Academy of Engineering in the United Kingdom [10], \nthe researchers claim that it is n ever easy to prepare an e -\nLearning Classroom. Indeed, they come up with a study and a \nbook titled, “Development of e -learning resources.”  Among their \nrecommendations, the researchers would like to adapt the \nfollowing:  \n \n✓ Commission Students: one way to sta rt with the e -learning \ncourses is to get students involved in the process. They may \nhave bright ideas to start with the e -learning platforms in \nan institution  \n✓ Creative Brainstorm:  Invite those who are knowledgeable \nor those who have expertise in terms of  e-learning \nresources development, including the Management \nInformation Systems’ Department to brainstorm with them \nand listen to all their ideas.  \n✓ Put e -learning in accreditation: If we suggest that this e -\nlearning system is put in accreditation, the effe ctive use of \ne-learning resources to support and enhance the \neducational experience of students will become part of the \naccreditation process. According to this study by the Royal \nAcademy by making this a subject for explicit consideration \nin the accredita tion process, universities will focus on it and \nimprove [10].  \n \nIn the similar study, they also suggested the use of Facebook and \nother Social Media to begin with the e -learning classrooms. In \nmany aspects, FB could be a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) \nwith much of similar functionality.  As compared to other Social \nMedia Platforms, FB is so familiar to almost all students all over \nthe world. Somehow, everyone has a ready -made account to \nbegin with the e -learning classroom.  In the Philippines, students \ncould utilize free data or they could buy a small amount of load to \naccess this tool.  Teachers could even start preparing the e -\nlearning classroom by creating a page or blogs for their students \nassuming that the English class should be able to communicate  in \nEnglish.  Thus, their confidence and ability to become creative \nwill be revealed.  \n \nQ6:  What problems have you encountered during the \nimplementation of the E -Learning classroom?  \nDespite the declaration for leniency among the students \nregarding the use of the E -Learning Classroom, not all students \nagree with this point.  Indeed, in one university, students \napproached their Dean to continue with the E -learning because \nthey do not wa nt to be idle during these moments of crisis.  \nHowever, many of them really could not access online, so the FB \nmessenger was used as an alternative mode of learning.  From \nthen on, the students became happy and tried to participate in THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            257 \n \n Train people Be prepared to \novercome problemsUse synchronous \nonline learning this advocacy.  In so me universities, the professors found out that \nthe students are not thoroughly prepared to embrace the E -\nlearning system in the classroom.  They have requested that an \norientation or a training should be prepared by the E -Learning \nDepartment to meet the de mands of their professors using the E -\nLearning Classrooms.  Some of them enjoy the traditional mode \nof learning and when this happened abruptly, some of them \ncould not believe that it was happening.  They may need a series, \nsegmental, hands -on experience o r seminar with a small group to \norient the faculty members and students in the use of all these E -\nLearning platforms to be consistent with the academic \nrequirements and balance the need for E -Learning and studying \ntheir own books.  Another important aspect  the professors have \nraised was the uniformity of the E -learning platform for all \nfaculty members and students that would fit the academic needs \nof the curriculum.  Although all these free platforms are easy to \nuse, the administration should look into the details of each \nplatform and determine the most suitable one to prepare the \ninstitution for future emergencies.  Students and teachers also \nhoped that during this crisis, Advanced Lessons, Intended \nLearning Outcomes, Quizzes, and Examinations are prepared per \nunit or chapter in order to cope with the lessons while having \nthis lockdown issue in every city.  The professors also opine that \nmajority of the students had no capacity to provide the resources \nlike a laptop or computer in their homes, thus, E -learni ng could \nbe difficult for them.  What others did was to load their mobile \nphones and get connected with the E -Learning platforms used by \ntheir professors.  Poor Internet connection was evident in all \ncases, thus producing poor interactions among the studen ts.  The \nprofessors tried to understand the situations and gave them time \nto read the uploaded materials.  The submission of all the \nexercises and quizzes were postponed to give them time to \nprepare their resources and to prioritize their safety. Finally, \nthere were some professors who have not experienced any \nproblems regarding the implementation of the E -learning \nClassrooms may be because they have the enough experience to \ndo all these tasks, they were already using the technology before \nthe outbreak, the y think positively that the situation will not get \nworst, and they may be motivated to conduct their classes online.  \nFinally, despite the encountered problems, teachers have become \ncreative in the delivery of their lessons with the help of the \nmanagement in guiding the whole institution in the conduct of \ntheir E -Learning Classrooms in their respective institutions.   \n \nGiven these problems encountered and some solutions \nprovided by the respondents, the Royal Academy has suggested a \nfew solutions to some of these problems which are modified by \nthe researchers for improvement:  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Recommendations for e -Learning  Solutions  \n \nOne possible way to make the e -learning classrooms work is to \ntrain those people involved in the e -learning program of an \ninstitution by some experts in the field of educational technology \nand development of e -resources.  Second, in terms of e mergency, \nbe prepared to overcome possible problems. Therefore, in lieu of \ntextbooks and references, there could be online materials for the \nfaculty members and students to read and work with.  Finally, it \nis advisable to utilize the synchronous online lea rning because \nthe students could benefit more on this approach.  Teachers \ncould utilize a simple video and interact with their students at the same time.  This will allow students to feel isolated and \nimproves quality of interaction.  \n \nIn the Webinar c ondu cted by Enderun Colleges [12 ] worldwide \non e -Learning, one of the speakers some of the best strategies of \ne-learning in the Philippine setting most especially in giving \nassessments. Teachers should consider the type of internet \naccess and device; academic load, and current level of digital \nproficiency. Also, teachers should provide more time, chances, or \nattempts for students to complete assessments, and give more \nfocus on facilitation over control. In comparison, Is mailova, et.al. \n[13] discloses that the r ole of e -learning tools in higher education \nprovides students and teachers with solutions to tasks such as \nproviding internet access at all times and from various locations \nfor each participant in the educational process, creating a \ncommon knowledge space and making efficient use of \neducational resources.  \n \nCONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION  \nThe E -Learning Classroom has been used and implemented in \nHigher Educational Institutions in the country amidst the COVID -\n19 crisis.  In this study, the professors utilized mostly the free \nplatforms such as: Google Classroom, Edmodo, Zoom, FB \nmessenger, Google meet, We Chat, Schoology, and Moodle. The \nprofessors and the students could easily adapt to these new \nchanges to align one selves in the 21st century skills of  learning. \nHowever, despite the presence of these platforms, there were \nconcerns raised by this study. One major problem is the lack of \ntraining of the faculty members and students in using the e -\nLearning classroom.  It is recommended that the HEI should \nconduct a thorough training and workshop for all students and \nfaculty in various platforms that could be appropriate to their \nacademic needs and to prepare the whole institution in times of \ncrisis like the COVID -19.  The second major dilemma is the lack of \nresources that will lead to unsuccessful e -learning classes.  It is \nrecommended that lessons, ILO’s, quizzes or examinations per \nunit may be prepared by the department concerned or an \nassessment department to make sure that the students have \nlearned what t hey ought to learn. In brief, Higher Education \nInstitutions have made the intervention successful, but this could \nstill be improved through the joint efforts of the administration, \ndeans, heads, and faculty members make the learning possible \nfor all studen ts via different e -learning solutions. Finally, this \naction research is recommended to conduct an in -depth study \nusing the structured interview to validate its findings.  \n \nREFERENCES  \n1. M.J. De Guzman and C.K. Pastor.

This action research examines the status of the implementation of the E -\nLearning classroom in selected HEI’s in Region IV -A by conducting a qualitative approach using a survey questionnaire to a small group \nof professionals who have been teaching various courses in the tertiary level. This study utilized the descripti ve method of research to \nbring out the current status of the implementation of the e -learning classroom in selected HEI’s. An online survey data were collected and \nanalyzed using the descriptive and documentary analysis. Findings indicate that the responde nts had good experiences in introducing \nthe E -learning classroom as an immediate response to the country\'s enhanced quarantine situation. Although all the E -learning platforms \nused by the respondents are free of charge, still, students have encountered pro blems like lack of resources, difficulty of Wi -Fi \nconnection, and lack of training among the students and faculty members. this study recommends professional development works hops \nfor both faculty members and students and preparation of advanced lessons, s lide presentations, and examinations per unit to cope with \nthe prescribed number of hours set by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).  It is also expected that this action resear ch would \nserve as a future guide for conducting an in -depth study using a structured interview to validate its findings.   \n \nKeywords  – COVID -19, E -Learning Classrooms, Platforms, Experiences, Professional Development, Training, Workshops  \n \n \n© 20 20 by Advance Scientific Research.

All the non -teaching personnel had to stop working and \nadvised by the President of the Philippines to stay at  home. \nCOVID -19 is a disease that could easily infect the immune system \nthat can cause greater harm to individuals who are infected. \nMany countries have declared a national emergency just like the \nPhilippines and the United States of America. De Guzman and  \nPastor [1] opines that the COVID -19 has no positive impact on \nthe world most especially on academic institutions like that of a \nHigher Educational Institutions (HEIs) of learning.  Most of the \ncities around the Philippines are empty.   All types of vehicl es are \nfew.  Important business establishments are open.  Conferences \nand meetings are strictly prohibited. Flights to and fro are \naffected and they have been grounded.  Some grocery stores and \ndrug stores are being emptied of masks, hand sanitizers, and \ndisinfecting medications. Students are advised to stay home and \nstudy by their own selves.  Everyone is in doubt as to when this \ncrisis would end [2].  \n   \nThere were no empirical studies related to the E -learning \nClassroom as an intervention in times of cri sis, or studies related \nto determine the status of E -Learning Classrooms in HEI’s; \nhowever, there are several researches that discuss E -Learning as \nan effective tool or strategy in teaching.  Chua, Sibbaluca, Mack, \net.al[3] suggested using the Virtual Lear ning Environment (VLE) \nas a technical tool for promoting the process of teaching and \nlearning. According to them, teachers should be innovative in \ndeveloping such an analytical learning atmosphere that will best \nfit the needs of today\'s generation of stude nts. \n McHaney, Reiter, and Reychay [4 ] confirm that simulation -based \nonline when combined with good pedagogical approaches, \nappropriate technology and educational technology, and the \npresence of experts will provide a better experience in \nsimulations.  Simulations could be so motivating tool for e -\nlearning classroom.  Bekmurat[5 ] mentions that because \ncomputer technology and the Internet are both boundless even a \nsmall boy has already been equipped with a device or a cell \nphone. It\'s no sur prise that new innovations have been part of \nthe cycle of teaching and learning.  \n \nThus, they recommend that teachers should make use of \nsimulations to integrate this effectively into their teaching \napproaches.  \n \nThe administrators, Deans, Heads, professors may work together \nto come up with the best E -learning solutions as an immediate \nintervention in these times of crisis.   \n \nThe researchers of this stud y initiated a survey to find out the \nstatus of the E -Learning Classrooms in various HEI’s in the \ncountry.  To learn their status means to provide the best \nalternative learning mode for the students and faculty members \nand to discover the best recommendatio ns from them while \ncurrently experiencing the E -learning Classrooms amidst the \nCOVID -19.    \n \nResearch Objective  \nThe main objective of this study was to find out the status of the \nimplementation of selected Higher Educational Institutions \n(HEIs) in Region I V-A in the conduct of their E -Learning \nClassrooms.  Specifically, it determined the experiences of faculty \nmembers in using the E -learning classroom; identified whether THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            254 \n \n the intervention was appropriate to each course; and discovered \nthe various types of fr ee platforms online.  Finally, the \nresearchers were able to find out some problems concerning the \nuse of the E -learning classrooms and possible solutions to \nimprove this type of intervention.  \n \nScope and Delimitation  \nThe study is limited to identifying the  status of the \nimplementation of the E -learning Classrooms in selected HEI’s in \nRegion IV -A and in determining the problems encountered with \nsome possible solutions to improve this intervention process.  \n \nThe Significance of the Study  \nThis action research will serve as a step -by-step guide to develop \nan in -depth analysis of the E -learning implementation in HEIs in \ntimes of emergencies such as the COVID -19.  This is also \napplicable to all types of urgencies when class suspensions have \nbeen declared by the in stitution or the whole country.  \n \nConceptual Framework of the Study  \nThe research paradigm used in this study is an action research \nwhich is generally common to qualitative research paradigm.  It \nincludes documentary collection and analysis, participant \nobservation using the online survey. The findings of the study \nwill ser ve as future work in conducting a structured interview to \nfurther improve the decisions in this study.  \n \nMETHODS AND PROCEDURE  \nThe work was carried out in three (3) stages. The first step was \nsearching online academic journals for the appropriate research  \npapers. The second step was the online survey of 15 professors \nteaching at different courses in Philippine Area IV -A.  These \ncourses include: Math, English, History, Social Sciences, NSTP, \nMarketing, Business, Computer Science and Courses in \nProfessional Education. These professionals were sent the survey \nlink, and they answered open -ended questions. The third process \nused the descriptive and documentary analysis to collect and \nanalyze all the findings.  \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \nThe massive action on E-learning classroom was the decision of \nalmost all the HEI’s in the Philippines amidst this crisis.  \nHowever, the Commission on Higher Education has declared for \nleniency to all HEIs so that students could cope with the \nrequirements set by their professor s. The researchers have \ndistributed an onlin e survey called survey monkey [6 ] to find out \nthe status of implementation of their E -learning Classroom and \nas an immediate intervention in these times of crisis.  \nWhen asked about the professors’ experiences in  the \nimplementation of the E -Learning Classroom in the Philippines, \nmajority had the positive remarks as shown below:  \n \nFigure 1:  Experience in the Implementation of the E -\nLearning Classroom  \n \nThe 15 professionals who are all from Cavite, Philippines in \nRegion IV -A, who responded to this question, 93.33% had \npositive experiences in the E -learning Classroom while 6.66% had a negative experience.  Most of the respondents feel great, \nhappy, and con venient with this transition.  The learning will \nnever get interrupted.  Some of them believe that this was the \nbest solution for this kind of situation.  Some of the professors \nalso mentioned that they enjoy the use of the E -learning \nClassroom even if it was their first time to use this platform.  \nStudents were also responding as they point out that they also \nwant to learn while staying in their own homes.  It was indeed a \nnice experience for most of the participants and because E -\nlearning is new, there wa s difficulty at the beginning; however, as \nthey were exploring how to utilize the platform, this becomes \neasy to utilize.  One professor also points out that this idea is not \nso encouraging.  Students who have no means to do the E -\nlearning Classroom would be receiving  the lowest marks in the \nclassroom.  \n \nIt is evident that teachers who have been positive in the use of \nthe E -Learning classrooms are those who are motivated to teach \nand to learn the new technology. Teacher’s motivation plays a \nvital role in pr oviding the best strategies for students, whether \nonline or traditional classrooms. In a Blog posted by UNESCO in \nthe Learning Portal, in order to improve the motivation level and \nstatus of teachers, there is a need to uplift their status to retain \nhigh -quality teachers who are  vital to improving education [7 ]. In \nthis blog, they stressed that when there is full support from the \nwork environment, it would create a positive working \nrelationships among people and these may reduce and improve \nteachers’ motivat ion and effectiveness.  \n \nAlthough it was fun and easy, teachers may be able to learn more \nhow to conduct it with the students.  Overall, the professors who \nwere teaching in various courses have positive feelings and \nexperience in using the E -Learning Classroom.  \n \nQ2:  Is the E -learning Classroom applicable to your course? \nWhy?  \nTable 1:  Reasons for E -learning Classroom to be Applicable \nor Not  \nApplicable \nor Not \nApplicable  Course/s  \nTaught  Reasons  \nYes English  \n(Grammar)  Materials are accessible. \nAssessments can be \nconducted easily.  \n English  \n(Literature)  Activities can easily be done \nonline.  The links are all \navailable online.  \n Social Studies  Both traditional and \nmodern approaches are \nimportant in Social Studies \nfield.  \n Business  Best alternative mode of \nlearning in times of crisis.  \n Computer \nScience  Easy to communicate with \nstudents and the lessons \ncan easily be transferred to \nthem via E -learning \nplatforms.  \n Professional \nEducation  \nCourses  PowerPoint presentations \ncan be done.  Interactions \nare similar to the Face -to-\nFace classroom. Students \ncan be seen on video and \nthey speak naturally when \nquestions are asked.  \n  Our students are future \neducators and they need to \nexperience this type of \ntransition. They should get \nused to it and apply this in \nTHE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            255 \n \n the future.  \n Marketing  This is very convenient \nbecause it relates to online \nmarketing  \n Psychology  This is very relevan t. I could \neasily provide links to my \nstudents. They could raise \nquestions immediately.  \nYes and NO  NSTP  Our course is purely \ncommunity -based project, \nso its usefulness is less \nadvantageous  \nNO Math  It is difficult to explain the \nformula online. Face to  face \nis still the best way for \nthem to learn.  \n \nDuring this COVID -19 crisis, many private companies and \nbusiness corporations have provided the HEI’s temporary online \nmaterials or platforms to address the immediate need of \ninstitutions most especially the teachers and students. These \nonline classrooms are extremely beneficial for the students when \nusing E -learning, it is not only considered add -on, it has become \npart of the educational setting. For example, in the field of IT, \nhaving intensiv e hands on helps prepare students for their future \njob rather than us ing the traditional textbooks [7 ].  If the \ninstitutions combine hands on activities, lecture, and E -learning, \nstudents have higher retention rates and greater productivity.   \n \nAnother example of a business company that has just recently \nestablished their customized learning experience platform is the \nOdilo.  It is intended for all levels, for every user, and learning \nprofile (skills, interest, age, aspirational job, level, etc.) .  They \ndesign the platform to match the brand and unique values and \nculture of individuals or institutions.  They adapt the learning \nexperience and its content to meet the needs of every learner  [8]. \nAs Kamenez[9 ] is of the opinion that involving teaching , self -\nlearning and self -control of knowledge and teachers in \ninformation technology can have greater advantages over this \ntechnical knowledge.  \n \nThe issue of applicability depends on the creativity of the \nprofessor teaching the course and the availability of resources \nthe students may have.  However, now that many companies \nhave offered their free products and services, HEI’s should grab \nthe opportunity to make use of these available resources for their \nstudents.  These could be a great aid in their studies  while \nmaking themselves safe and secure in their homes.  \n \nQ3:  Which learning platforms are you currently using for \nyour students to learn at these times of crisis?  \n \n \nFigure 2:  Learning Platforms Used by the Professors  \n Most of the professors find the Facebook Messenger to be one of \nthe most convenient mode of alternative learning.  This is most \nespecially when the students could not afford to be connected \nwith Wi -Fi.  In FB messenger, if the students have free data, they  \ncould easily see the instruction of their professors including the \ntasks they need to do.  The Google Classroom is one of the best \nplatforms which could be accessed for free by an institution or an \nindividual faculty member.  In this platform, the profess or could \ncreate a class, assignments, tasks, announcements, or chats with \nhis/her students.  Edmodo is another popular E -learning \nplatform that has a similar feature like the Google Classroom. \nEdmodo is a user -friendly platform that could create a class, \nsubmit assignment, post a message or announcement, and could \nupload and share materials for the students.  Zoom is a free video \ncall meeting where a teacher can share his/her slide presentation \nthat everyone could see.  Students could interact and raise \nquestions to their professors.  They could also see each other \nonline and ask questions during the lecture.  For those who have \nslow connections, the professor could even write the important \nmessages on chat boards.  With this platform, students feel \ncomforta ble and easy to learn the topic.  Just like Google \nClassroom and Edmodo, Schoology allows the teachers to create \na class and uploads resources and materials online.  This is \nsomething new to them and would continue to explore its \nusefulness.  Google Meet h as similar features with Zoom. \nStudents could be seen online and interact with their teacher. \nMoodle has also a similar feature with Edmodo and Google \nClassroom while we chat is used for chatting and uploading \nmaterials to students. Although these E -learni ng platforms are \nfree, the availability of resources could be the hindrance why \nstudents or teachers could not fully utilize them.  However, \nteachers and students alike should be grateful that these E -\nlearning platforms could be available without charge fr om the \ninstitution or individual.  They make the academic life easier \nmost especially during these COVID -19 crises.  \n \nThe E -learning platforms the professors have been using are the \nmost popular ones.  However, there are other platforms which \nhave not been  explored yet like:  Lark, Odilo, Big Marker, and \nmany others. This means that e -Learning Classrooms are very \npopular around the world, most especially during crisis or \nemergency. The COVId -19 has revealed vulnerabilities in colleges \nand universities aroun d the globe.  It is clear that society needs \nflexible and resilient education systems while fac ing the \nunpredictable futures [10 ]. \n \nQ4:  How do your students respond to your alternative mode \nof learning?  \n \n \nTable 2:  Students’ Response to Alternative Learning Mode  \nN Students’ Response  \n1 Enjoyable, easy to use, it interests the students.  \n2 The students were active in the beginning, but they have \nstarted to be passive when they heard some \nannouncements about ONLINE suspension.  \n3 Enthusiastic. Some are not happy.  \n4 Positive  \n5 They could easily communicate during their preferred \ntime.  \n6 Responsive. They are interested to learn.  \n7 Happy. Sometimes they are confused due to many \nworkloads.  \n8 Extremely happy. They prefer this mode of learning to be \nwith their loved ones.  \n9 Positive a nd Negative responses because not all of them \nhave the Internet connections.  \n10 Protesting.  Many want to go on vacation.  \nN Students’ Response  \n11 They are interested to learn even if they only have free \nTHE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            256 \n \n data.  \n12 Enjoyable and exciting  \n13 At the beginning, it was difficult, but some of them go \nonline earlier than their professor.  \n14 Fine and fun  \n15 Not everyone is interested due to lack of resources.  \n \nIn general, students enjoy the E -learning platforms used by their \nprofessors. However, there were some who could not really get \nconnected due to slow connection or they have no capacity to \nproduce the resources.  To some students, it is their first time to  \nutilize these platforms and they have difficulty accessing them.  \nThey have limited time to learn how to utilize them thus, \ndelaying the submission of their assignments online.  To some \nstudents, they thought that this crisis is temporary and they \nprefer to go on vacation rather than to learn or to study, but they \nwere also those who are eager to learn and stay positive that this \ncrisis would not last long.  They believe that the intervention \nprovided to them is just temporary and the first thing to do is to \nobey or comply with their professors. Since the Commission on \nHigher Education has declared to be more lenient on E -learning \nclassroom issues, the professors become more humble to ask \ntheir students first before implementing a new platform.  This \naction  makes the students delighted and become interested to \nstudy.  \nIn comparison with Q1, teachers have enjoyed using the E -\nLearning classroom, however, students do have their positive as \nwell as negative experien ces too. In an article online [10 ], the \nauthors  brought out some positive as well as negative types of \nstudent experiences.  The shift from Face -to-Face classroom to \nthe e -learning sessions would mean an initial great increase in \nthe number of hours work both on the sides of students and \nteachers; howe ver, these may result to a very promising result.  \nOther institutions have already resorted to using coursera, zoom, \nand other videoconferencing platforms just to make sure that the \nteaching and learning process take place whether in an \nasynchronous or syn chronous approach.  The researchers would \nconclude that those universities who utilized these approaches \nseveral years ago would benefit from these e -learning \nclassrooms because they have enough experience with these \ntechnological tools and they could deli ver their own courses \ncorrectly and properly with the support of their institutions.   \n \nNevertheless, in the Philippines setting, colleges and universities \nhave struggled with accommodating the abrupt change from F -\nto-F to online learning due to lack of te chnological resources of \nfaculty members and students.  Undeniably, when the \nCommission on Higher Education declares to put leniency about \nthis online classroom issue, some institutions have totally \nsuspended their E -Learning Classroom classes.  However, s ome \nof these Universities have continued and offer a simple type of \nlearning on Facebook Messenger and simply sending messages \nvia E -mails. This means that many of these HEIs have not been \nready to face the new challenge, but there is a need to provide an \nurgent solution thus, E -Learning Classrooms have been created, \nwhether the institution is READY OR NOT?  \n \nIn some institutions in Australia, they also experienced difficulty \nof switching from F to F to online classes. Some professors and \ntheir leaders are facing problems in this immediate transition.   \nSome of their concerns are students do not have access to Wi-Fi \nor computers [11 ].  \n \nThe whole world is experiencing similar experiences, although \nstudents do enjoy learning online, they also struggle to find  \nsolutions to their own problems in order to learn and receive \ninstructions from their professors online. Those who could do \nsomething even amidst this COVID -19, are those who are really \nwilling to learn and continue to nourish their minds with \nknowledge.  Those who could not do anything could not be blamed because they had no means to do it even if they try all \ntheir best.   \n \nQ5:  How was the preparation of the e -learning Classroom?  \n(This is on the p art of the Professors in HEI’s)  \nThe majority of the respondents say that the preparation was \neasy.  There were eight who gladly share their preparation \nexperience.  The platform is accessible and very comfortable to \napply it while staying at home with their families.  One professor \nshare d that providing tasks to students is easy, but the burden on \nthe part of the teacher is the checking of their work because \nwhen these will all be collected, it will entail time and efforts to \ncorrect them.  Others do enjoy uploading of slide presentations  \nor sending them links to follow.  Some teachers say it was \ndifficult but rewarding most especially if you are the one making \nand editing the video. There were seven participants who \ndeclared difficult due to some reasons like: (1) no perfect Wi -Fi \nconnect ion, it was difficult to explain Math online, Social Studies \nneed an actual insight and opinion, so doing it online could be \ndifficult to express oneself.   \n \nAt the Royal Academy of Engineering in the United Kingdom [10], \nthe researchers claim that it is n ever easy to prepare an e -\nLearning Classroom. Indeed, they come up with a study and a \nbook titled, “Development of e -learning resources.”  Among their \nrecommendations, the researchers would like to adapt the \nfollowing:  \n \n✓ Commission Students: one way to sta rt with the e -learning \ncourses is to get students involved in the process. They may \nhave bright ideas to start with the e -learning platforms in \nan institution  \n✓ Creative Brainstorm:  Invite those who are knowledgeable \nor those who have expertise in terms of  e-learning \nresources development, including the Management \nInformation Systems’ Department to brainstorm with them \nand listen to all their ideas.  \n✓ Put e -learning in accreditation: If we suggest that this e -\nlearning system is put in accreditation, the effe ctive use of \ne-learning resources to support and enhance the \neducational experience of students will become part of the \naccreditation process. According to this study by the Royal \nAcademy by making this a subject for explicit consideration \nin the accredita tion process, universities will focus on it and \nimprove [10].  \n \nIn the similar study, they also suggested the use of Facebook and \nother Social Media to begin with the e -learning classrooms. In \nmany aspects, FB could be a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) \nwith much of similar functionality.  As compared to other Social \nMedia Platforms, FB is so familiar to almost all students all over \nthe world. Somehow, everyone has a ready -made account to \nbegin with the e -learning classroom.  In the Philippines, students \ncould utilize free data or they could buy a small amount of load to \naccess this tool.  Teachers could even start preparing the e -\nlearning classroom by creating a page or blogs for their students \nassuming that the English class should be able to communicate  in \nEnglish.  Thus, their confidence and ability to become creative \nwill be revealed.  \n \nQ6:  What problems have you encountered during the \nimplementation of the E -Learning classroom?  \nDespite the declaration for leniency among the students \nregarding the use of the E -Learning Classroom, not all students \nagree with this point.  Indeed, in one university, students \napproached their Dean to continue with the E -learning because \nthey do not wa nt to be idle during these moments of crisis.  \nHowever, many of them really could not access online, so the FB \nmessenger was used as an alternative mode of learning.  From \nthen on, the students became happy and tried to participate in THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            257 \n \n Train people Be prepared to \novercome problemsUse synchronous \nonline learning this advocacy.  In so me universities, the professors found out that \nthe students are not thoroughly prepared to embrace the E -\nlearning system in the classroom.  They have requested that an \norientation or a training should be prepared by the E -Learning \nDepartment to meet the de mands of their professors using the E -\nLearning Classrooms.  Some of them enjoy the traditional mode \nof learning and when this happened abruptly, some of them \ncould not believe that it was happening.  They may need a series, \nsegmental, hands -on experience o r seminar with a small group to \norient the faculty members and students in the use of all these E -\nLearning platforms to be consistent with the academic \nrequirements and balance the need for E -Learning and studying \ntheir own books.  Another important aspect  the professors have \nraised was the uniformity of the E -learning platform for all \nfaculty members and students that would fit the academic needs \nof the curriculum.  Although all these free platforms are easy to \nuse, the administration should look into the details of each \nplatform and determine the most suitable one to prepare the \ninstitution for future emergencies.  Students and teachers also \nhoped that during this crisis, Advanced Lessons, Intended \nLearning Outcomes, Quizzes, and Examinations are prepared per \nunit or chapter in order to cope with the lessons while having \nthis lockdown issue in every city.  The professors also opine that \nmajority of the students had no capacity to provide the resources \nlike a laptop or computer in their homes, thus, E -learni ng could \nbe difficult for them.  What others did was to load their mobile \nphones and get connected with the E -Learning platforms used by \ntheir professors.  Poor Internet connection was evident in all \ncases, thus producing poor interactions among the studen ts.  The \nprofessors tried to understand the situations and gave them time \nto read the uploaded materials.  The submission of all the \nexercises and quizzes were postponed to give them time to \nprepare their resources and to prioritize their safety. Finally, \nthere were some professors who have not experienced any \nproblems regarding the implementation of the E -learning \nClassrooms may be because they have the enough experience to \ndo all these tasks, they were already using the technology before \nthe outbreak, the y think positively that the situation will not get \nworst, and they may be motivated to conduct their classes online.  \nFinally, despite the encountered problems, teachers have become \ncreative in the delivery of their lessons with the help of the \nmanagement in guiding the whole institution in the conduct of \ntheir E -Learning Classrooms in their respective institutions.   \n \nGiven these problems encountered and some solutions \nprovided by the respondents, the Royal Academy has suggested a \nfew solutions to some of these problems which are modified by \nthe researchers for improvement:  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Recommendations for e -Learning  Solutions  \n \nOne possible way to make the e -learning classrooms work is to \ntrain those people involved in the e -learning program of an \ninstitution by some experts in the field of educational technology \nand development of e -resources.  Second, in terms of e mergency, \nbe prepared to overcome possible problems. Therefore, in lieu of \ntextbooks and references, there could be online materials for the \nfaculty members and students to read and work with.  Finally, it \nis advisable to utilize the synchronous online lea rning because \nthe students could benefit more on this approach.  Teachers \ncould utilize a simple video and interact with their students at the same time.  This will allow students to feel isolated and \nimproves quality of interaction.  \n \nIn the Webinar c ondu cted by Enderun Colleges [12 ] worldwide \non e -Learning, one of the speakers some of the best strategies of \ne-learning in the Philippine setting most especially in giving \nassessments. Teachers should consider the type of internet \naccess and device; academic load, and current level of digital \nproficiency. Also, teachers should provide more time, chances, or \nattempts for students to complete assessments, and give more \nfocus on facilitation over control. In comparison, Is mailova, et.al. \n[13] discloses that the r ole of e -learning tools in higher education \nprovides students and teachers with solutions to tasks such as \nproviding internet access at all times and from various locations \nfor each participant in the educational process, creating a \ncommon knowledge space and making efficient use of \neducational resources.  \n \nCONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION  \nThe E -Learning Classroom has been used and implemented in \nHigher Educational Institutions in the country amidst the COVID -\n19 crisis.  In this study, the professors utilized mostly the free \nplatforms such as: Google Classroom, Edmodo, Zoom, FB \nmessenger, Google meet, We Chat, Schoology, and Moodle. The \nprofessors and the students could easily adapt to these new \nchanges to align one selves in the 21st century skills of  learning. \nHowever, despite the presence of these platforms, there were \nconcerns raised by this study. One major problem is the lack of \ntraining of the faculty members and students in using the e -\nLearning classroom.  It is recommended that the HEI should \nconduct a thorough training and workshop for all students and \nfaculty in various platforms that could be appropriate to their \nacademic needs and to prepare the whole institution in times of \ncrisis like the COVID -19.  The second major dilemma is the lack of \nresources that will lead to unsuccessful e -learning classes.  It is \nrecommended that lessons, ILO’s, quizzes or examinations per \nunit may be prepared by the department concerned or an \nassessment department to make sure that the students have \nlearned what t hey ought to learn. In brief, Higher Education \nInstitutions have made the intervention successful, but this could \nstill be improved through the joint efforts of the administration, \ndeans, heads, and faculty members make the learning possible \nfor all studen ts via different e -learning solutions. Finally, this \naction research is recommended to conduct an in -depth study \nusing the structured interview to validate its findings.  \n \nREFERENCES  \n1. M.J. De Guzman and C.K. Pastor.

All the non -teaching personnel had to stop working and \nadvised by the President of the Philippines to stay at  home. \nCOVID -19 is a disease that could easily infect the immune system \nthat can cause greater harm to individuals who are infected. \nMany countries have declared a national emergency just like the \nPhilippines and the United States of America. De Guzman and  \nPastor [1] opines that the COVID -19 has no positive impact on \nthe world most especially on academic institutions like that of a \nHigher Educational Institutions (HEIs) of learning.  Most of the \ncities around the Philippines are empty.   All types of vehicl es are \nfew.  Important business establishments are open.  Conferences \nand meetings are strictly prohibited. Flights to and fro are \naffected and they have been grounded.  Some grocery stores and \ndrug stores are being emptied of masks, hand sanitizers, and \ndisinfecting medications. Students are advised to stay home and \nstudy by their own selves.  Everyone is in doubt as to when this \ncrisis would end [2].  \n   \nThere were no empirical studies related to the E -learning \nClassroom as an intervention in times of cri sis, or studies related \nto determine the status of E -Learning Classrooms in HEI’s; \nhowever, there are several researches that discuss E -Learning as \nan effective tool or strategy in teaching.  Chua, Sibbaluca, Mack, \net.al[3] suggested using the Virtual Lear ning Environment (VLE) \nas a technical tool for promoting the process of teaching and \nlearning. According to them, teachers should be innovative in \ndeveloping such an analytical learning atmosphere that will best \nfit the needs of today\'s generation of stude nts. \n McHaney, Reiter, and Reychay [4 ] confirm that simulation -based \nonline when combined with good pedagogical approaches, \nappropriate technology and educational technology, and the \npresence of experts will provide a better experience in \nsimulations.  Simulations could be so motivating tool for e -\nlearning classroom.  Bekmurat[5 ] mentions that because \ncomputer technology and the Internet are both boundless even a \nsmall boy has already been equipped with a device or a cell \nphone. It\'s no sur prise that new innovations have been part of \nthe cycle of teaching and learning.  \n \nThus, they recommend that teachers should make use of \nsimulations to integrate this effectively into their teaching \napproaches.  \n \nThe administrators, Deans, Heads, professors may work together \nto come up with the best E -learning solutions as an immediate \nintervention in these times of crisis.   \n \nThe researchers of this stud y initiated a survey to find out the \nstatus of the E -Learning Classrooms in various HEI’s in the \ncountry.  To learn their status means to provide the best \nalternative learning mode for the students and faculty members \nand to discover the best recommendatio ns from them while \ncurrently experiencing the E -learning Classrooms amidst the \nCOVID -19.    \n \nResearch Objective  \nThe main objective of this study was to find out the status of the \nimplementation of selected Higher Educational Institutions \n(HEIs) in Region I V-A in the conduct of their E -Learning \nClassrooms.  Specifically, it determined the experiences of faculty \nmembers in using the E -learning classroom; identified whether THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            254 \n \n the intervention was appropriate to each course; and discovered \nthe various types of fr ee platforms online.  Finally, the \nresearchers were able to find out some problems concerning the \nuse of the E -learning classrooms and possible solutions to \nimprove this type of intervention.  \n \nScope and Delimitation  \nThe study is limited to identifying the  status of the \nimplementation of the E -learning Classrooms in selected HEI’s in \nRegion IV -A and in determining the problems encountered with \nsome possible solutions to improve this intervention process.  \n \nThe Significance of the Study  \nThis action research will serve as a step -by-step guide to develop \nan in -depth analysis of the E -learning implementation in HEIs in \ntimes of emergencies such as the COVID -19.  This is also \napplicable to all types of urgencies when class suspensions have \nbeen declared by the in stitution or the whole country.  \n \nConceptual Framework of the Study  \nThe research paradigm used in this study is an action research \nwhich is generally common to qualitative research paradigm.  It \nincludes documentary collection and analysis, participant \nobservation using the online survey. The findings of the study \nwill ser ve as future work in conducting a structured interview to \nfurther improve the decisions in this study.  \n \nMETHODS AND PROCEDURE  \nThe work was carried out in three (3) stages. The first step was \nsearching online academic journals for the appropriate research  \npapers. The second step was the online survey of 15 professors \nteaching at different courses in Philippine Area IV -A.  These \ncourses include: Math, English, History, Social Sciences, NSTP, \nMarketing, Business, Computer Science and Courses in \nProfessional Education. These professionals were sent the survey \nlink, and they answered open -ended questions. The third process \nused the descriptive and documentary analysis to collect and \nanalyze all the findings.  \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \nThe massive action on E-learning classroom was the decision of \nalmost all the HEI’s in the Philippines amidst this crisis.  \nHowever, the Commission on Higher Education has declared for \nleniency to all HEIs so that students could cope with the \nrequirements set by their professor s. The researchers have \ndistributed an onlin e survey called survey monkey [6 ] to find out \nthe status of implementation of their E -learning Classroom and \nas an immediate intervention in these times of crisis.  \nWhen asked about the professors’ experiences in  the \nimplementation of the E -Learning Classroom in the Philippines, \nmajority had the positive remarks as shown below:  \n \nFigure 1:  Experience in the Implementation of the E -\nLearning Classroom  \n \nThe 15 professionals who are all from Cavite, Philippines in \nRegion IV -A, who responded to this question, 93.33% had \npositive experiences in the E -learning Classroom while 6.66% had a negative experience.  Most of the respondents feel great, \nhappy, and con venient with this transition.  The learning will \nnever get interrupted.  Some of them believe that this was the \nbest solution for this kind of situation.  Some of the professors \nalso mentioned that they enjoy the use of the E -learning \nClassroom even if it was their first time to use this platform.  \nStudents were also responding as they point out that they also \nwant to learn while staying in their own homes.  It was indeed a \nnice experience for most of the participants and because E -\nlearning is new, there wa s difficulty at the beginning; however, as \nthey were exploring how to utilize the platform, this becomes \neasy to utilize.  One professor also points out that this idea is not \nso encouraging.  Students who have no means to do the E -\nlearning Classroom would be receiving  the lowest marks in the \nclassroom.  \n \nIt is evident that teachers who have been positive in the use of \nthe E -Learning classrooms are those who are motivated to teach \nand to learn the new technology. Teacher’s motivation plays a \nvital role in pr oviding the best strategies for students, whether \nonline or traditional classrooms. In a Blog posted by UNESCO in \nthe Learning Portal, in order to improve the motivation level and \nstatus of teachers, there is a need to uplift their status to retain \nhigh -quality teachers who are  vital to improving education [7 ]. In \nthis blog, they stressed that when there is full support from the \nwork environment, it would create a positive working \nrelationships among people and these may reduce and improve \nteachers’ motivat ion and effectiveness.  \n \nAlthough it was fun and easy, teachers may be able to learn more \nhow to conduct it with the students.  Overall, the professors who \nwere teaching in various courses have positive feelings and \nexperience in using the E -Learning Classroom.  \n \nQ2:  Is the E -learning Classroom applicable to your course? \nWhy?  \nTable 1:  Reasons for E -learning Classroom to be Applicable \nor Not  \nApplicable \nor Not \nApplicable  Course/s  \nTaught  Reasons  \nYes English  \n(Grammar)  Materials are accessible. \nAssessments can be \nconducted easily.  \n English  \n(Literature)  Activities can easily be done \nonline.  The links are all \navailable online.  \n Social Studies  Both traditional and \nmodern approaches are \nimportant in Social Studies \nfield.  \n Business  Best alternative mode of \nlearning in times of crisis.  \n Computer \nScience  Easy to communicate with \nstudents and the lessons \ncan easily be transferred to \nthem via E -learning \nplatforms.  \n Professional \nEducation  \nCourses  PowerPoint presentations \ncan be done.  Interactions \nare similar to the Face -to-\nFace classroom. Students \ncan be seen on video and \nthey speak naturally when \nquestions are asked.  \n  Our students are future \neducators and they need to \nexperience this type of \ntransition. They should get \nused to it and apply this in \nTHE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            255 \n \n the future.  \n Marketing  This is very convenient \nbecause it relates to online \nmarketing  \n Psychology  This is very relevan t. I could \neasily provide links to my \nstudents. They could raise \nquestions immediately.  \nYes and NO  NSTP  Our course is purely \ncommunity -based project, \nso its usefulness is less \nadvantageous  \nNO Math  It is difficult to explain the \nformula online. Face to  face \nis still the best way for \nthem to learn.  \n \nDuring this COVID -19 crisis, many private companies and \nbusiness corporations have provided the HEI’s temporary online \nmaterials or platforms to address the immediate need of \ninstitutions most especially the teachers and students. These \nonline classrooms are extremely beneficial for the students when \nusing E -learning, it is not only considered add -on, it has become \npart of the educational setting. For example, in the field of IT, \nhaving intensiv e hands on helps prepare students for their future \njob rather than us ing the traditional textbooks [7 ].  If the \ninstitutions combine hands on activities, lecture, and E -learning, \nstudents have higher retention rates and greater productivity.   \n \nAnother example of a business company that has just recently \nestablished their customized learning experience platform is the \nOdilo.  It is intended for all levels, for every user, and learning \nprofile (skills, interest, age, aspirational job, level, etc.) .  They \ndesign the platform to match the brand and unique values and \nculture of individuals or institutions.  They adapt the learning \nexperience and its content to meet the needs of every learner  [8]. \nAs Kamenez[9 ] is of the opinion that involving teaching , self -\nlearning and self -control of knowledge and teachers in \ninformation technology can have greater advantages over this \ntechnical knowledge.  \n \nThe issue of applicability depends on the creativity of the \nprofessor teaching the course and the availability of resources \nthe students may have.  However, now that many companies \nhave offered their free products and services, HEI’s should grab \nthe opportunity to make use of these available resources for their \nstudents.  These could be a great aid in their studies  while \nmaking themselves safe and secure in their homes.  \n \nQ3:  Which learning platforms are you currently using for \nyour students to learn at these times of crisis?  \n \n \nFigure 2:  Learning Platforms Used by the Professors  \n Most of the professors find the Facebook Messenger to be one of \nthe most convenient mode of alternative learning.  This is most \nespecially when the students could not afford to be connected \nwith Wi -Fi.  In FB messenger, if the students have free data, they  \ncould easily see the instruction of their professors including the \ntasks they need to do.  The Google Classroom is one of the best \nplatforms which could be accessed for free by an institution or an \nindividual faculty member.  In this platform, the profess or could \ncreate a class, assignments, tasks, announcements, or chats with \nhis/her students.  Edmodo is another popular E -learning \nplatform that has a similar feature like the Google Classroom. \nEdmodo is a user -friendly platform that could create a class, \nsubmit assignment, post a message or announcement, and could \nupload and share materials for the students.  Zoom is a free video \ncall meeting where a teacher can share his/her slide presentation \nthat everyone could see.  Students could interact and raise \nquestions to their professors.  They could also see each other \nonline and ask questions during the lecture.  For those who have \nslow connections, the professor could even write the important \nmessages on chat boards.  With this platform, students feel \ncomforta ble and easy to learn the topic.  Just like Google \nClassroom and Edmodo, Schoology allows the teachers to create \na class and uploads resources and materials online.  This is \nsomething new to them and would continue to explore its \nusefulness.  Google Meet h as similar features with Zoom. \nStudents could be seen online and interact with their teacher. \nMoodle has also a similar feature with Edmodo and Google \nClassroom while we chat is used for chatting and uploading \nmaterials to students. Although these E -learni ng platforms are \nfree, the availability of resources could be the hindrance why \nstudents or teachers could not fully utilize them.  However, \nteachers and students alike should be grateful that these E -\nlearning platforms could be available without charge fr om the \ninstitution or individual.  They make the academic life easier \nmost especially during these COVID -19 crises.  \n \nThe E -learning platforms the professors have been using are the \nmost popular ones.  However, there are other platforms which \nhave not been  explored yet like:  Lark, Odilo, Big Marker, and \nmany others. This means that e -Learning Classrooms are very \npopular around the world, most especially during crisis or \nemergency. The COVId -19 has revealed vulnerabilities in colleges \nand universities aroun d the globe.  It is clear that society needs \nflexible and resilient education systems while fac ing the \nunpredictable futures [10 ]. \n \nQ4:  How do your students respond to your alternative mode \nof learning?  \n \n \nTable 2:  Students’ Response to Alternative Learning Mode  \nN Students’ Response  \n1 Enjoyable, easy to use, it interests the students.  \n2 The students were active in the beginning, but they have \nstarted to be passive when they heard some \nannouncements about ONLINE suspension.  \n3 Enthusiastic. Some are not happy.  \n4 Positive  \n5 They could easily communicate during their preferred \ntime.  \n6 Responsive. They are interested to learn.  \n7 Happy. Sometimes they are confused due to many \nworkloads.  \n8 Extremely happy. They prefer this mode of learning to be \nwith their loved ones.  \n9 Positive a nd Negative responses because not all of them \nhave the Internet connections.  \n10 Protesting.  Many want to go on vacation.  \nN Students’ Response  \n11 They are interested to learn even if they only have free \nTHE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            256 \n \n data.  \n12 Enjoyable and exciting  \n13 At the beginning, it was difficult, but some of them go \nonline earlier than their professor.  \n14 Fine and fun  \n15 Not everyone is interested due to lack of resources.  \n \nIn general, students enjoy the E -learning platforms used by their \nprofessors. However, there were some who could not really get \nconnected due to slow connection or they have no capacity to \nproduce the resources.  To some students, it is their first time to  \nutilize these platforms and they have difficulty accessing them.  \nThey have limited time to learn how to utilize them thus, \ndelaying the submission of their assignments online.  To some \nstudents, they thought that this crisis is temporary and they \nprefer to go on vacation rather than to learn or to study, but they \nwere also those who are eager to learn and stay positive that this \ncrisis would not last long.  They believe that the intervention \nprovided to them is just temporary and the first thing to do is to \nobey or comply with their professors. Since the Commission on \nHigher Education has declared to be more lenient on E -learning \nclassroom issues, the professors become more humble to ask \ntheir students first before implementing a new platform.  This \naction  makes the students delighted and become interested to \nstudy.  \nIn comparison with Q1, teachers have enjoyed using the E -\nLearning classroom, however, students do have their positive as \nwell as negative experien ces too. In an article online [10 ], the \nauthors  brought out some positive as well as negative types of \nstudent experiences.  The shift from Face -to-Face classroom to \nthe e -learning sessions would mean an initial great increase in \nthe number of hours work both on the sides of students and \nteachers; howe ver, these may result to a very promising result.  \nOther institutions have already resorted to using coursera, zoom, \nand other videoconferencing platforms just to make sure that the \nteaching and learning process take place whether in an \nasynchronous or syn chronous approach.  The researchers would \nconclude that those universities who utilized these approaches \nseveral years ago would benefit from these e -learning \nclassrooms because they have enough experience with these \ntechnological tools and they could deli ver their own courses \ncorrectly and properly with the support of their institutions.   \n \nNevertheless, in the Philippines setting, colleges and universities \nhave struggled with accommodating the abrupt change from F -\nto-F to online learning due to lack of te chnological resources of \nfaculty members and students.  Undeniably, when the \nCommission on Higher Education declares to put leniency about \nthis online classroom issue, some institutions have totally \nsuspended their E -Learning Classroom classes.  However, s ome \nof these Universities have continued and offer a simple type of \nlearning on Facebook Messenger and simply sending messages \nvia E -mails. This means that many of these HEIs have not been \nready to face the new challenge, but there is a need to provide an \nurgent solution thus, E -Learning Classrooms have been created, \nwhether the institution is READY OR NOT?  \n \nIn some institutions in Australia, they also experienced difficulty \nof switching from F to F to online classes. Some professors and \ntheir leaders are facing problems in this immediate transition.   \nSome of their concerns are students do not have access to Wi-Fi \nor computers [11 ].  \n \nThe whole world is experiencing similar experiences, although \nstudents do enjoy learning online, they also struggle to find  \nsolutions to their own problems in order to learn and receive \ninstructions from their professors online. Those who could do \nsomething even amidst this COVID -19, are those who are really \nwilling to learn and continue to nourish their minds with \nknowledge.  Those who could not do anything could not be blamed because they had no means to do it even if they try all \ntheir best.   \n \nQ5:  How was the preparation of the e -learning Classroom?  \n(This is on the p art of the Professors in HEI’s)  \nThe majority of the respondents say that the preparation was \neasy.  There were eight who gladly share their preparation \nexperience.  The platform is accessible and very comfortable to \napply it while staying at home with their families.  One professor \nshare d that providing tasks to students is easy, but the burden on \nthe part of the teacher is the checking of their work because \nwhen these will all be collected, it will entail time and efforts to \ncorrect them.  Others do enjoy uploading of slide presentations  \nor sending them links to follow.  Some teachers say it was \ndifficult but rewarding most especially if you are the one making \nand editing the video. There were seven participants who \ndeclared difficult due to some reasons like: (1) no perfect Wi -Fi \nconnect ion, it was difficult to explain Math online, Social Studies \nneed an actual insight and opinion, so doing it online could be \ndifficult to express oneself.   \n \nAt the Royal Academy of Engineering in the United Kingdom [10], \nthe researchers claim that it is n ever easy to prepare an e -\nLearning Classroom. Indeed, they come up with a study and a \nbook titled, “Development of e -learning resources.”  Among their \nrecommendations, the researchers would like to adapt the \nfollowing:  \n \n✓ Commission Students: one way to sta rt with the e -learning \ncourses is to get students involved in the process. They may \nhave bright ideas to start with the e -learning platforms in \nan institution  \n✓ Creative Brainstorm:  Invite those who are knowledgeable \nor those who have expertise in terms of  e-learning \nresources development, including the Management \nInformation Systems’ Department to brainstorm with them \nand listen to all their ideas.  \n✓ Put e -learning in accreditation: If we suggest that this e -\nlearning system is put in accreditation, the effe ctive use of \ne-learning resources to support and enhance the \neducational experience of students will become part of the \naccreditation process. According to this study by the Royal \nAcademy by making this a subject for explicit consideration \nin the accredita tion process, universities will focus on it and \nimprove [10].  \n \nIn the similar study, they also suggested the use of Facebook and \nother Social Media to begin with the e -learning classrooms. In \nmany aspects, FB could be a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) \nwith much of similar functionality.  As compared to other Social \nMedia Platforms, FB is so familiar to almost all students all over \nthe world. Somehow, everyone has a ready -made account to \nbegin with the e -learning classroom.  In the Philippines, students \ncould utilize free data or they could buy a small amount of load to \naccess this tool.  Teachers could even start preparing the e -\nlearning classroom by creating a page or blogs for their students \nassuming that the English class should be able to communicate  in \nEnglish.  Thus, their confidence and ability to become creative \nwill be revealed.  \n \nQ6:  What problems have you encountered during the \nimplementation of the E -Learning classroom?  \nDespite the declaration for leniency among the students \nregarding the use of the E -Learning Classroom, not all students \nagree with this point.  Indeed, in one university, students \napproached their Dean to continue with the E -learning because \nthey do not wa nt to be idle during these moments of crisis.  \nHowever, many of them really could not access online, so the FB \nmessenger was used as an alternative mode of learning.  From \nthen on, the students became happy and tried to participate in THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE E -LEARNING CLASSROOM  IN SELECTED HIGHER EDUCAT ION \nINSTITUTIONS IN REGION IV -A  AMIDST THE COVID -19 CRISIS\n \n \n Journal of critical reviews                                                                                                                                            257 \n \n Train people Be prepared to \novercome problemsUse synchronous \nonline learning this advocacy.  In so me universities, the professors found out that \nthe students are not thoroughly prepared to embrace the E -\nlearning system in the classroom.  They have requested that an \norientation or a training should be prepared by the E -Learning \nDepartment to meet the de mands of their professors using the E -\nLearning Classrooms.  Some of them enjoy the traditional mode \nof learning and when this happened abruptly, some of them \ncould not believe that it was happening.  They may need a series, \nsegmental, hands -on experience o r seminar with a small group to \norient the faculty members and students in the use of all these E -\nLearning platforms to be consistent with the academic \nrequirements and balance the need for E -Learning and studying \ntheir own books.  Another important aspect  the professors have \nraised was the uniformity of the E -learning platform for all \nfaculty members and students that would fit the academic needs \nof the curriculum.  Although all these free platforms are easy to \nuse, the administration should look into the details of each \nplatform and determine the most suitable one to prepare the \ninstitution for future emergencies.  Students and teachers also \nhoped that during this crisis, Advanced Lessons, Intended \nLearning Outcomes, Quizzes, and Examinations are prepared per \nunit or chapter in order to cope with the lessons while having \nthis lockdown issue in every city.  The professors also opine that \nmajority of the students had no capacity to provide the resources \nlike a laptop or computer in their homes, thus, E -learni ng could \nbe difficult for them.  What others did was to load their mobile \nphones and get connected with the E -Learning platforms used by \ntheir professors.  Poor Internet connection was evident in all \ncases, thus producing poor interactions among the studen ts.  The \nprofessors tried to understand the situations and gave them time \nto read the uploaded materials.  The submission of all the \nexercises and quizzes were postponed to give them time to \nprepare their resources and to prioritize their safety. Finally, \nthere were some professors who have not experienced any \nproblems regarding the implementation of the E -learning \nClassrooms may be because they have the enough experience to \ndo all these tasks, they were already using the technology before \nthe outbreak, the y think positively that the situation will not get \nworst, and they may be motivated to conduct their classes online.  \nFinally, despite the encountered problems, teachers have become \ncreative in the delivery of their lessons with the help of the \nmanagement in guiding the whole institution in the conduct of \ntheir E -Learning Classrooms in their respective institutions.   \n \nGiven these problems encountered and some solutions \nprovided by the respondents, the Royal Academy has suggested a \nfew solutions to some of these problems which are modified by \nthe researchers for improvement:  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Recommendations for e -Learning  Solutions  \n \nOne possible way to make the e -learning classrooms work is to \ntrain those people involved in the e -learning program of an \ninstitution by some experts in the field of educational technology \nand development of e -resources.  Second, in terms of e mergency, \nbe prepared to overcome possible problems. Therefore, in lieu of \ntextbooks and references, there could be online materials for the \nfaculty members and students to read and work with.  Finally, it \nis advisable to utilize the synchronous online lea rning because \nthe students could benefit more on this approach.  Teachers \ncould utilize a simple video and interact with their students at the same time.  This will allow students to feel isolated and \nimproves quality of interaction.  \n \nIn the Webinar c ondu cted by Enderun Colleges [12 ] worldwide \non e -Learning, one of the speakers some of the best strategies of \ne-learning in the Philippine setting most especially in giving \nassessments. Teachers should consider the type of internet \naccess and device; academic load, and current level of digital \nproficiency. Also, teachers should provide more time, chances, or \nattempts for students to complete assessments, and give more \nfocus on facilitation over control. In comparison, Is mailova, et.al. \n[13] discloses that the r ole of e -learning tools in higher education \nprovides students and teachers with solutions to tasks such as \nproviding internet access at all times and from various locations \nfor each participant in the educational process, creating a \ncommon knowledge space and making efficient use of \neducational resources.  \n \nCONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION  \nThe E -Learning Classroom has been used and implemented in \nHigher Educational Institutions in the country amidst the COVID -\n19 crisis.  In this study, the professors utilized mostly the free \nplatforms such as: Google Classroom, Edmodo, Zoom, FB \nmessenger, Google meet, We Chat, Schoology, and Moodle. The \nprofessors and the students could easily adapt to these new \nchanges to align one selves in the 21st century skills of  learning. \nHowever, despite the presence of these platforms, there were \nconcerns raised by this study. One major problem is the lack of \ntraining of the faculty members and students in using the e -\nLearning classroom.  It is recommended that the HEI should \nconduct a thorough training and workshop for all students and \nfaculty in various platforms that could be appropriate to their \nacademic needs and to prepare the whole institution in times of \ncrisis like the COVID -19.  The second major dilemma is the lack of \nresources that will lead to unsuccessful e -learning classes.  It is \nrecommended that lessons, ILO’s, quizzes or examinations per \nunit may be prepared by the department concerned or an \nassessment department to make sure that the students have \nlearned what t hey ought to learn. In brief, Higher Education \nInstitutions have made the intervention successful, but this could \nstill be improved through the joint efforts of the administration, \ndeans, heads, and faculty members make the learning possible \nfor all studen ts via different e -learning solutions. Finally, this \naction research is recommended to conduct an in -depth study \nusing the structured interview to validate its findings.  \n \nREFERENCES  \n1. M.J. De Guzman and C.K. Pastor.
